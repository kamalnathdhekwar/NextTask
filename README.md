# Project Overview

Welcome to my Next.js project, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This repository showcases a frontend user interface (UI) designed as part of an assignment before joining an frontened engineer internship provided by Arsh Goyal.

## Task Description

The objective of this project is to create a frontend UI for a page that displays data with filters. The UI design is inspired by the current interface of [proelevate.in](https://proelevate.in). The page is intended to present data in a structured format, along with options to refine and filter the displayed data. The technologies used in this project are Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
